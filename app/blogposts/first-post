First Post: Coming of Age in the World of Software
2012-08-05
<p>I have been stuck. For the last 12 years I have viewed writing software as merely a tool to make money. Specifically, it has been a tool to fund times of travel when I am not writing software. 
Spending several years at stretch always looking forward to the next jumping out point means that I am not enjoying the present for a strong majority of my life. I need to enjoy my life in every possible moment, and that means enjoying the craft of software development for its own sake.</p>

<p>This site is part of that process. An artist must have a portfolio. What have you done? What are you capable of? These questions must constantly be answered on the quest to find fulfilling work in any field.</p>

<p>I had several goals when I conceived the idea of this site. First and foremost was to create a web presence. Privacy is always something that I have valued, and a web presence has been resisted mainly for this reason. Second: a visible proof of my skills that I can continue to improve upon. Third: a way to become comfortable with front-end development, something I have always felt insecure about. Fourth: bringing my skills up to speed after a year of travel and a career of only learning the necessary skills for the task at hand.</p>

<p>The site is far from complete. There are many improvements to be made, some of which I am even aware. However, in the spirit of ‘deploy early, deploy often’ it is time to move forward. The first deployment took a bit longer than I had anticipated, but this should surprise no practitioner of the craft.</p>

<p>Finally, thanks to the folks that have supported me in this process over the last chunk of time. Special thanks to Samantha Anne for help with visual design. More thanks to all of the authors and contributors to every open source software package that I have used. I may have been able to do it without you but it would have taken the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Hello World!</p>
